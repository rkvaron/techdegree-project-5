In this project, we’ve provided an index.html file with a set of class names already defined. You will be responsible for creating rules to style the web page using each of those class names. This will provide you with a set of classes that you can then use in other projects to apply similar styles. You'll create a sass project to do this, using partials, variables, extends, and mixins to apply the styles and classes to the style guide page. When done, you’ll have a Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites using the BEM syntax classes you’ve created.
